## INTRODUCTION
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.

**Objective:** This Project aims to Predict whether the first stage of SpaceY will be re used or not & thereby determine overall cost.

### SUMMARY OF METHODOLOGIES
* Data Collection and Preprocessing: Ensured high-quality data through cleaning, normalization, and encoding.
* Exploratory Data Analysis: analyzed and visualized data to understand its key characteristics, uncover patterns, and identify relationships between variables.
* Feature Engineering: Created derived features to enhance predictive power.
* Visualizations and Insights: Provided clear visualizations and insights into key factors influencing landing success and cost implications.
* Predictive Modeling: Used a Random Forest Classifier to predict landing success with high accuracy.

### SUMMARY OF ALL RESULTS
* Overall result was satisfactory. Gathered insights based on patterns found during EDA & Visualization.
* SVM Model predicted correct data & solved questions raised during discussion.
* Cost was determined.
