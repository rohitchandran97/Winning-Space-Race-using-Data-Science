## INTRODUCTION
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.

Objective: This Project aims to Predict whether the first stage of SpaceY will be re used or not & thereby determine overall cost.
